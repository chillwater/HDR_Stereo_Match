Warning: matlabpool will be removed in a future release.
To query the size of an already started parallel pool, query the 'NumWorkers'
property of the pool.
To check if a pool is already started use 'isempty(gcp('nocreate'))'. 
Warning: matlabpool will be removed in a future release.
To shutdown a parallel pool use 'delete(gcp('nocreate'))' instead. 
Parallel pool using the 'local' profile is shutting down.
Did not find any pre-existing communicating jobs created by parpool.

Warning: matlabpool will be removed in a future release.
Use parpool instead. 
Starting matlabpool using the 'local' profile ... connected to 4 workers.
